# KitAVR
Hardware was designed with Proteus 8 and firmware written with Atmel Studio 7.0
It has a full implemented driver for PS/2 keyboards with the so known "scan codes"
There are routines for rd/wr RAM in an external module (an old ST chip with batteries attached to it) and to EEPROM as well. I have a refurbished I/O board with 20 outputs and 40 inputs that I reverse engineered and has been included in the simulation.
This is a project of free time, just made for fun and to get better insight of mcs, avrs, combinational logic etc.
Changes to the firmware will be updated at the simulation. ATmega8 works like a real keyboard microcontroller, so if you put keys into that circuit you can make a real keyboard and send key strokes to your PC.
Some years ago I have read at a forum from this guy who was asking $500 bucks for implementing the ps/2 routine. So there it is. For free.
